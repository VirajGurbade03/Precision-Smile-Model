## Overview
**Precision Smile** is an AI-driven system designed to improve orthodontic treatment planning by automating cephalometric analysis. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflows, and deliver personalized patient care.

## Motivation
Manual cephalometric analysis is a time-consuming process prone to human errors. By integrating artificial intelligence, we aim to provide orthodontists with a precise and automated tool for landmark detection and 3D craniofacial assessment.

## Features
- Automated cephalometric landmark detection
- Real-time diagnostics and visualization
- Integration of 3D craniofacial imaging
- Support for personalized treatment planning

## Research Aim and Objectives
### Aim
To develop an AI-driven system that enhances orthodontic treatment planning by automating cephalometric analysis and improving landmark detection accuracy.

### Objectives
1. Develop machine learning models for accurate cephalometric landmark detection.
2. Integrate real-time 3D imaging for personalized treatment simulations.
3. Validate the system using standardized datasets in real-world clinical environments.

## Methodology
Our methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection**: Cephalometric X-ray images from reliable sources.
2. **Preprocessing**: Image normalization and augmentation.
3. **Model Development**: Training machine learning models for landmark detection.
4. **Validation**: Evaluating model performance on unseen data.
5. **Deployment**: Building a user-friendly interface for orthodontists.

## Datasets
A sample dataset used for this project consists of annotated cephalometric X-ray images. Future versions may include advanced 3D imaging data.

## Results
The model has shown promising results in detecting cephalometric landmarks with high accuracy, enabling orthodontists to make more informed decisions.
